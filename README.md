I've taken and edited this source code, now you are unlikely to get a VAC ban!

If you get an error, add the reference dlls to references in the visual studio

# Steps
- Deleted Write Memory
- Deleted NoRecoil
- Deleted Recoil Crosshair

U can Add Triggerbot if u want

# how to add triggerbot
hmm.. easy
Use this project for triggerbot --> https://github.com/Rolesional/CS-GO-Safe-Read-Only-Triggerbot
You can remove the usercmd command, and it to add a triggerbot that works with the logic of "mouse1"

This project uses VAMemory so undetectable for now

I'm sure it's undetected but I'm not responsible for possible vac bans
